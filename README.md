# TODOs

- Add completion percentage to the pomodoro output
- Add TODO functionality, as a user I want to be able to quickly note down things I need to do and have them stored somewhere,
  so that I can come back to them later.
- When pomodoro is active I want to be able to say that I completed a given todo, or started working on it, so that I can keep track of what I'm doing.
- pomo status command
- central store for todos over network so that I can access them from multiple devices


## Pomodoro Note

* From the time perspective looking at the past 500 pomodoros I would like to know what exactly I was doing, that means urls to resources, my thoughts, etc., not just one
  word description of the task.
* One pomodoro is just a small piece of the puzzle that usually adds up towards a bigger goal, so I would like to be able to see the bigger picture. Meaning that pomodoros
  should be linked to goals.

  Example:

Watching DDD stuff on youtube                                                                     
```

This is from old pomodoro last year, sure it is far better than nothing but now I am also learning DD and I wish I knew where
I stopped, what I liked and what I didn't like. I wish I added my thoughts besides just the task name. I am aware that it might
be a lot for a single pomodoro. But perhaps notes like my thoughts and so on could all be added towards the goal of learning DDD.
This way I would just query the goal and see all the pomodoros that are linked to it with all notes.

Because the main value of the pomodoro is fist tracking of pomodoros, planned time and actual time, when it happened, and
the second part is what I was doing, the third part might be what did I think of it and was it a good use of my time or not. Data is king
after all, that's why I want to track this stuff.


Here is another note that I really like:

Working on pomo-cli                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                     
I didn't want to start this pomodoro session but I just                                                                                                                                              
decided to start the timer and work for a minute or two                                                                                                                                              
and stop it. Turns out i've worked for around 40 minutes                                                                                                                                             
and the time flied by.                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Pomodoro is really adding value.
