# TODOs

- Add completion percentage to the pomodoro output
- Add TODO functionality, as a user I want to be able to quickly note down things I need to do and have them stored somewhere,
  so that I can come back to them later.
- When pomodoro is active I want to be able to say that I completed a given todo, or started working on it, so that I can keep track of what I'm doing.
